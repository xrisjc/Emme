# Emme

Emme is a text edit with a minimalist user interface and an emphasis on using the keyboard.

There are no official releases of Emme right now. The only way to get Emme is to clone this repository and build with Visual Studio 2010 or later (any edition should work).

Emme free software and is release under the GPL 3.0 license.
