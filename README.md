# Emme

Emme is a text editor with a minimalist user interface and an emphasis on using
the keyboard. Emme is written in C# 6 and targets .NET 4.6. Right now the GUI
is WinForms, but this may change in the future.

There are no official releases of Emme right now. The only way to get Emme is
to clone this repository and build with Visual Studio 2015.

Emme free software and is release under the MIT license.
